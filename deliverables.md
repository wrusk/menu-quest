 Welcome to Menu Quest. Please enter commands to navigate the Web Site and discover the hidden menu. This navigation represents a state of the art user experience 20 year in the making. Please enjoy exploring these cutting edge navigation tools, and consider what you can do to improve your own Web sites.
 
 
 *About Me*
 
 I am a developer from Atlanta that has basically been working with the World Wide Web since there has been a World Wide Web to work with. Some of the first things that I programmed were text adventures written in Basic. It was fun finding a way to bring those initial development experiences to you in a new way. If you want to find out more about me, please check out my about.me profile.
 
 
 *On User Interfaces and Navigation*
 
 While this is ultimately just an April Fools joke, many of the best April Fools jokes give us an opportunity to think about things differently and explore old ideas with a new perspective. I hope that this will provide similar opportunities to think about navigation and user interfaces on the Web.
